### If you're reading this, have a nice day \(‚Ä¢‚ó°‚Ä¢)/

### Perpetual basement dweller dev w/ a bleak outlook on the future of life w.r.t AI | Been creating *stuff* for 10+ years now & have built all sorts of weird shit in that time. Over the last few years I predominantly spent time creating crypto trading software & SMM AI tools. 

### Most of my time currently is spent on my new baby, Juice, allowing twitter users to fork their personalities & deploy them as AI agents who tweet for them from their account 24/7. Doing my part in contributing to the AI takeover ü§ù.

Dev profiles are kinda cringe but if you're interested, virtually anything possible to create on solana, I can build. Virtually anything possible to create with AI, I can build. Below is a small list of some of the more relevant parts of my avg tech stack when creating a complex crypto AI product.

- Building agent-powered bots using LangChain + GPT
- Custom inference microservices (TorchServe / TensorFlow serving)
- Edge-AI on WASM: running small models in Solana programs
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack for agents
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM for classic ML
- Docker + Kubernetes for scalable model serving
- MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- ONNX exports for cross-environment compatibility
- Normie tech stack shit goes without saying

I might speak a bit like an imbecile but it's a small price to pay if you are blessed by god and get the chance to work w/ me ‚ï≠‚à©‚ïÆ(-_-)‚ï≠‚à©‚ïÆ

**I am not 'for hire' lol, pls do not contact me to try & pay me to build something for you. Only interested in working on cool things w/ cool people where product upside is shared :)**
