Dev profiles are kinda cringe but if you're interested, virtually anything possible to create on solana, I can build. Virtually anything possible to create with AI, I can build. Below is a small list of some of the more relevant parts of my avg tech stack when creating a complex crypto AI product.

- Building agent-powered bots using LangChain + GPT
- Custom inference microservices (TorchServe / TensorFlow serving)
- Edge-AI on WASM: running small models in Solana programs
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack for agents
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM for classic ML
- Docker + Kubernetes for scalable model serving
- MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- ONNX exports for cross-environment compatibility
- Normie tech stack shit goes without saying

I might speak a bit like an imbecile but it's a small price to pay if you are blessed by god and get the chance to work w/ me â•­âˆ©â•®(-_-)â•­âˆ©â•®
